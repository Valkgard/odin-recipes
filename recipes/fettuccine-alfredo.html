    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces (340g) fettuccine pasta
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Cook the Pasta</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and set aside, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Alfredo Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Once the butter is melted, pour in the heavy cream. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer gently for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>If the sauce seems too thick, you can add a bit of the reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Season the sauce with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Remember that the Parmesan cheese is already salty, so go easy on the salt.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the cooked and drained fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Gently toss the pasta in the sauce until it's evenly coated.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the creamy Fettuccine Alfredo among serving plates.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately while the dish is hot and the sauce is velvety.
        </li>
    </ol>
