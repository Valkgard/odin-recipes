    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Bolognese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Saut√© until the vegetables are softened and the onion is
            translucent.
        </li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and pork. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, and dried thyme.
        </li>
        <li>If using red wine, pour it into the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes to cook off the alcohol.
            Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the Bolognese sauce to simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This allows
            the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat once done.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Bechamel Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the flour to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns a
            light golden color.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously to avoid lumps.
        </li>
        <li>Continue to whisk and cook the mixture until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>Add a pinch of nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3: Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven according to the lasagna noodle package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of Bolognese sauce to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a layer of Bolognese sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of Bechamel sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese over the sauces.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process with noodles, Bolognese sauce, Bechamel sauce, and cheeses until you've used up
            all the ingredients. End with a layer of cheeses on top.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the
            edges are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Serve the Bolognese Lasagna slices warm and enjoy the delicious layers of flavor!
